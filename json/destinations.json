    "overview": "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System. It is approximately 238,855 miles away from Earth and has a diameter of about 3,476 km. The Moon is believed to have formed around 4.5 billion years ago from debris left over after a Mars-sized object collided with Earth. The Moon's surface is characterized by vast plains, impact craters, mountains, and deep valleys. The Moon has no atmosphere or magnetic field, and its temperature varies greatly between its day and night sides. The Moon is also known for its phases, caused by its orbit around Earth, and for its effect on tides.",

It has a diameter of about 6,792 km and is about 142.2 million miles away from the Sun. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, and it has the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, as well as the longest canyon, Valles Marineris. The planet has a very cold climate, with an average temperature of about -80 degrees Fahrenheit. There is evidence of water on Mars in the form of ice and there have been numerous missions to Mars by various space agencies in an attempt to understand the planet and search for signs of past or present life.",

Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, which causes a greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the Solar System, with surface temperatures reaching up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit. The planet's surface is mostly covered by volcanoes, mountains, and vast plains. It also has a thick layer of clouds that are composed mostly of sulfuric acid. Venus has a very slow rotation on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is longer than its year. There have been several missions to Venus by various space agencies to study its atmosphere, surface and potential for past or present life.",

It has a large number of moons, with 79 known to be in orbit around the planet. The most notable of Jupiter's moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, also known as the Galilean moons, which were first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Jupiter also has a large, colorful atmosphere with bands of clouds, storms, and the Great Red Spot, a giant swirling storm that has been present for at least 350 years. The planet also has a strong magnetic field and radiation belts.",

Saturn is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter, and it has a similar atmosphere with bands of clouds and storms. However, the most striking feature of Saturn is its ring system, which is made up of countless small particles of ice and rock. The rings are divided into several distinct parts, including the B ring, the C ring, and the D ring. Saturn also has a significant number of known moons, with 82 moons in orbit around the planet, including the largest moon in the Solar System, Titan, and the geologically active Enceladus.",

Uranus is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn, but it has a much colder atmosphere, with an average temperature of about -357 degrees Fahrenheit. Uranus has a unique feature among the planets in our solar system: it has an extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, which means that it essentially rotates on its side. This causes its seasons to be extreme, with one pole facing the sun for 84 Earth years, followed by the other pole facing the sun for the next 84 years. Uranus also has a ring system, which is made up of narrow, dark rings, and 27 known moons, the most notable of which is Miranda.",

Like Uranus, Neptune is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, but it has a much colder atmosphere, with an average temperature of about -353 degrees Fahrenheit. Neptune has a blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. It has a ring system, which is made up of five narrow, faint rings, and 14 known moons, the most notable of which is Triton. Triton is a large, icy moon that has a retrograde orbit, meaning it orbits in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. ",

    "overview": "Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the Solar System beyond Neptune that is home to many small, icy bodies. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was originally classified as the ninth planet in the Solar System. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" due to its small size and the discovery of other similar objects in the Kuiper Belt. Pluto has a diameter of about 2,377 km and is about 4.67 billion miles away from the Sun. It is composed mostly of rock and ice. It has five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is a large, icy moon that is about half the size of Pluto and it is so large that it causes Pluto and Charon to be considered as a binary system, because they both orbit a common center of mass. Pluto has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit, which at its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is inside Neptune's orbit. It takes 248.09 Earth years to orbit the Sun once.",

    "overview": "Gargantua is a massive and rapidly spinning black hole that is orbited by a number of celestial bodies, including the planets Miller and Mann, as well as an unnamed neutron star. It is located within a year's flight of the main sequence star Pantagruel and the habitable planet Edmunds. Gargantua is also within a several week spaceflight of the Wormhole, which was one of the first discoveries made by NASA after sending probes through it. Although the Lazarus Missions did not engage in much study of Gargantua, NASA's interstellar relay was able to determine its gravitational influence on its planetary system. According to calculations by Kip Thorne, Gargantua is about 100 million solar masses, making it a supermassive black hole. It has an intense gravitational pull and spinning at an extremely high rate, which warps and distorts the space around it",
