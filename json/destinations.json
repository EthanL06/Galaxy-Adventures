    "overview": "Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the Solar System beyond Neptune that is home to many small, icy bodies. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was originally classified as the ninth planet in the Solar System. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" due to its small size and the discovery of other similar objects in the Kuiper Belt. Pluto has a diameter of about 2,377 km and is about 4.67 billion miles away from the Sun. It is composed mostly of rock and ice. It has five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is a large, icy moon that is about half the size of Pluto and it is so large that it causes Pluto and Charon to be considered as a binary system, because they both orbit a common center of mass. Pluto has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit, which at its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) is inside Neptune's orbit. It takes 248.09 Earth years to orbit the Sun once.",

    "amenities": "Pluto, with its intriguing features and captivating environment, provides a range of amenities for those who venture to this distant world. One of the most remarkable sights is its surface, which is covered in a blanket of methane and nitrogen ice, with complex geological formations such as mountains and valleys carved into it. The dwarf planet also has five known moons, each with their own unique terrain and geological features, providing ample opportunity for exploration and discovery. Another intriguing aspect of Pluto is its thin atmosphere, composed of nitrogen and methane, which is constantly changing and creating stunning hazes in the planet's sky. The dwarf planet's location in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system rich in icy bodies, also provides a unique opportunity to study the formation and evolution of the solar system. With all these features and more, Pluto is a fascinating destination for space enthusiasts and scientists alike.",

    "duration": "25 years",

    "overview": "Gargantua is a massive and rapidly spinning black hole that is orbited by a number of celestial bodies, including the planets Miller and Mann, as well as an unnamed neutron star. It is located within a year's flight of the main sequence star Pantagruel and the habitable planet Edmunds. Gargantua is also within a several week spaceflight of the Wormhole, which was one of the first discoveries made by NASA after sending probes through it. Although the Lazarus Missions did not engage in much study of Gargantua, NASA's interstellar relay was able to determine its gravitational influence on its planetary system. According to calculations by Kip Thorne, Gargantua is about 100 million solar masses, making it a supermassive black hole. It has an intense gravitational pull and spinning at an extremely high rate, which warps and distorts the space around it",

    "amenities": "Gargantua, the massive black hole at the center of the Interstellar universe, offers a unique and awe-inspiring environment for those who dare to venture near its event horizon. One of the most spellbinding sights is the accretion disk, a swirling maelstrom of matter and energy that spirals into the black hole. The disk is illuminated by the intense radiation and heat generated by the friction of matter colliding and being consumed by the black hole. Another fascinating aspect of Gargantua is the tidal forces it generates, which can distort and elongate objects that approach too closely. The event horizon itself is a demarcation point beyond which no matter or energy can escape the black hole's immense gravitational pull. These and other intriguing features make Gargantua a destination like no other, offering a glimpse into the mysterious and complex realm of black holes.",
    "activities": "Gargantua, the massive black hole, provides a wealth of activities for those who venture into this mysterious and awe-inspiring world.
